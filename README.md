# Influencer-Style-Language-Model
The Influencer Style Language Model aims to generate text in the style of a chosen influencer, such as Justin Welsh. The project encompasses data gathering from social media platforms, data processing, sentiment analysis, fine-tuning a GPT-2 language model, and developing a user interface for interaction.
